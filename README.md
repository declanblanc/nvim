Created this repository for my own version control so I don't mess anything up while I learn nvim.

At this point things feel pretty nicely set up. Language servers are working and file navigation is smooth. Still getting used to using vim and when I'm at work I typically start on vim but end up switching to vscode to aovid the little things that still slow me down.

I'd like to make updates like this a regular thing to encourage more mindful updates.
